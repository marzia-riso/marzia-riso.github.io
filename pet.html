				<figcaption>We propose an interactive method to edit the parameters of procedural programs that generate vector patterns, where users
					interactively transform a set of points and constrain other ones to fixed locations. During the interaction, we solve for the procedural
					parameters with a gradient-based method since our patterns are differentiable with respect to the procedural parameters for both boundary
					and interior points. Here we show, for each pattern, the starting, middle and end frames of two sequential edits. We
					mark in blue the transformed points, in red the fixed ones, and we draw the trajectory of the transformed points in blue in the middle frame.

				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<p class="p-summary s-content">
					Procedural assets are used in computer graphics applications since variations can be obtained by changing the parameters
					of the procedural programs. As the number of parameters increases, editing becomes cumbersome as users have to manually
					navigate a large space of choices. Many methods in the literature have been proposed to estimate parameters from example
					images, which works well for initial starting points. For precise edits, inverse manipulation approaches let users manipulate the
					output asset interactively, while the system determines the procedural parameters.
					In this work, we focus on editing procedural vector patterns, which are collections of vector primitives generated by procedural
					programs. Recent work has shown how to estimate procedural parameters from example images and sketches, that we
					complement here by proposing a method for direct manipulation. In our work, users select and interactively transform a set
					of shape points, while also constraining other selected points. Our method then optimizes for the best pattern parameters
					using gradient-based optimization of the differentiable procedural functions. We support edits on large variety of patterns with
					different shapes, symmetries, continuous and discrete parameters, and with or without occlusions.
